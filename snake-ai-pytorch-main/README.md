# Teach AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

Utilized Python libraries to construct an autonomous agent (the snake) capable of self-play and self-training in the snake game based on Rewards & Penalities. Technologies used : PyTorch and PyGame Python libraries, Object Oriented Programming. A simple Deep-Q network involving 256 neurons and 11 states as input.
